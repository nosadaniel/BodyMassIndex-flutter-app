Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).\\n\\nI declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\\nto US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as \"Precious Stones and Jewellry\" in other that its\\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \\n\\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\\n\\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries\" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \\n\\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\\n\\nExpecting your response urgently.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nMr. Ben Suleman\\n\\n' urls=[] extra_emails=[] is_phishing=True\n",

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. \\nI have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. \\nThis money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband\\'s properties is under the authority of the family\\'s lawyer Tony Musa. \\n \\nMy Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband\\'s wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the \"Personal will\" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!\\nurther advise,! no relations or fr! \\niends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. \\nThe situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this \"SOS\" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. \\nI hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. \\nThe documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. \\nPlease, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. \\nPlease all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him (my Attorney) on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. \\nI look forward to your quick response. \\nBest Wishes, \\nMrs. Maryam Abacha \\n \\n\\n\\n' urls=[] extra_emails=['tony_m@lawyer.com'] is_phishing=True\n",

Here in\\nNIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute\\nwith years of outstanding service to the people of\\nAfrica.\\n\\nI have resolved to contact you through this medium\\nbased on business proposal that will be of mutual\\nbenefit to both of us. I got your particulars through\\na consultant company base on my research for a\\ntrustworthy and established person that understands\\ninvestment ethic for entering into a life time\\nprofitable joint partnership investment and also\\nco-operation with confidence and trust that you will\\nkeep the contents secret and divulged to any third\\nparty.\\n\\nTo be explicit and straight to the point. Some time\\nearly 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a\\nconsignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.\\nAnd since then our client has failed to come forward\\nto claim his consignment, which has accumulated a\\nconsiderable amount of money in demurrage.\\n\\nConsequently, in our bide to contact this client to\\nredeem the demurrage which his consignment had\\naccumulated we discovered that our client was the\\nformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who\\ndied of illness after he was de-throwed in the same\\nyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.\\n\\nSince the death of our client President Mobutou\\nSeseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to\\nclaim the consignment with us, which means that non of\\nhis relatives or aids had any knowledge of this\\nconsignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to\\nsecretly open the two boxes that our client deposited\\nin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the\\ntwo boxes that were registered as treasurer by our\\nclient actually contained a considerable amount of\\nmoney in United States Dollars amounting to about\\nUS$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have\\nbeen nursing plans secretly. I also found out from\\nenquiries and the foreign media that our late client\\nsiphoned a lot of money from his country while he was\\nin office as head of state.\\n\\nIt is my conviction that the consignment in our vault\\nwas part of the money that our client siphoned and now\\nthat he is dead there is no race to this money in our\\ncare.\\n\\nI am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me\\nin transferring this money out of nigeria to your\\ncountry for immediate investment with your assistance.\\nI have also decided that you will generously be\\nentitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt\\nof your reply confirming your willingness to assist me\\nof this transaction, I will immediately arrange and\\ntransfer all the rights of ownership of this\\nconsignment to your name to facilitate your easy\\nclearance and transfer of the complete funds to your\\ncountry.\\n\\nyou have nothing to worry about, as I will  be there\\nto assist you in anyway necessary with all proper\\ndocumentation.\\n\\nThis transaction is 100% risk free.\\n\\nPlease maintain absolute confidentiality on this\\nmatter.\\n\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nYours faithfully.\\n\\nMR.

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).\\n\\nI declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\\nto US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as \"Precious Stones and Jewellry\" in other that its\\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \\n\\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\\n\\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries\" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \\n\\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\\n\\nExpecting your response urgently.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nMr. Ben Suleman\\n\\n send reply to this []\\n    click this link  []\\n    date: Thu, 31 Oct 2002 05:10:00 -0000\\n\\n  OPTIONAL URLs ANALYSIS RESULT:\\n    []\\n\\n  ADDITIONAL EMAIL ADDRESS\\n    []\\n  \\n  EMAIL_IS_PHISHING:\\n    True\\n\\n  RESPONSE STRUCTURE:\\n  \\n  ', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\n",

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. \\nI have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. \\nThis money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband\\'s properties is under the authority of the family\\'s lawyer Tony Musa. \\n \\nMy Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband\\'s wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the \"Personal will\" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!\\nurther advise,! no relations or fr! \\niends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. \\nThe situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this \"SOS\" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. \\nI hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. \\nThe documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. \\nPlease, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody.

Some time\\nearly 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a\\nconsignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.\\nAnd since then our client has failed to come forward\\nto claim his consignment, which has accumulated a\\nconsiderable amount of money in demurrage.\\n\\nConsequently, in our bide to contact this client to\\nredeem the demurrage which his consignment had\\naccumulated we discovered that our client was the\\nformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who\\ndied of illness after he was de-throwed in the same\\nyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.\\n\\nSince the death of our client President Mobutou\\nSeseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to\\nclaim the consignment with us, which means that non of\\nhis relatives or aids had any knowledge of this\\nconsignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to\\nsecretly open the two boxes that our client deposited\\nin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the\\ntwo boxes that were registered as treasurer by our\\nclient actually contained a considerable amount of\\nmoney in United States Dollars amounting to about\\nUS$30 million Dollar.
